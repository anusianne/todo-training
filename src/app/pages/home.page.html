                        He turned on his heel and with a swish
                        of his cloak, he was gone.
                        A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and

                        bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and
                        pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very
                        moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up
                        their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter â€” the boy
                        who lived!"
